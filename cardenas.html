<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>A native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Brenda Cárdenas is the author of two poetry collections, From the Tongues of Brick and Stone (Momotombo Press) and Boomerang (Bilingual Review Press), as well as the co-editor of Between the Heart and the Land / Entre el corazon y la tierra: Latina Poets in the Midwest. 
She writes in a blend of English and Spanish, which she has said reflects her interest in "the interconnectedness and juxtapositions of difference and similarity between seemingly disparate peoples, events, places, and experiences." 
While Cárdenas often writes in free verse, she also experiments with a variety of forms, and, as Craig Santos Perez has noted, "This syncretic formal impulse reflects the polyphonic texture of Cárdenas's language-scape." 
She chose to write "Song" entirely in English, and its powerful description exemplifies her search for meaning through a close look at her environment. 
Her poetry appears in a number of anthologies and journals, including The City Visible: Chicago Poetry for the New Century (Cracked Slab Books, 2007) and The Wind Shifts: New Latino Poetry (University of Arizona Press, 2007). 
She is a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. </p>
